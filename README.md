I've always wanted to be able to send an SMS from a computer.

It is possible by subscribing to an SMS service like Twilio, but I mean
if I have a SIM card, why shouldn't I be able to use it?

I'm sure there is software and hardware for this. However, when playing with
my LTE router, I discovered that it has this feature! At least from the web
control panel, it is possible to send and receive SMS messages. A little
reverse engineering of the API lead to this script for sending messages.

I don't use my LTE router with a SIM these days but one day I might put this
to use. Until then, someone else might be able to use it too.
