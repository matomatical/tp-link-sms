I've always wanted to be able to send an SMS from a computer.
It is possible by subscribing to an SMS service like Twilio, but I mean
if I have a SIM card, why shouldn't one be able to use it? And why should
it require an internet connection, if one already has a cellular connection?

I'm sure there is software and hardware for this. However, when playing with
my LTE router, I discovered that it has this feature! At least from the web
control panel, it is possible to send and receive SMS messages, and the router
has a phone number.

A little reverse engineering of the API lead to this script for sending
messages.
I don't use my LTE router with a SIM these days but one day I might put this
to use. Until then, someone else might be able to use it too.

Note: I'm pretty sure there is an android binary somewhere in the router
powering the cellular and LTE connection, no idea how (in)secure it is.
